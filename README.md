YouTube automatically resizes videos in embedded iframes to ensure they always fit within the screen. The empty space is filled with black bars, which isn't ideal in video headers.

This plugin attempts to counteract the letterboxing effect by resizing the iframe to ensure the video always fills the screen.

*Note: This only works with widescreen videos for now.*
